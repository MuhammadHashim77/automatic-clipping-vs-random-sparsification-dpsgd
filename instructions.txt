The dicom-images-test and dicom-images-train dirs inside data/ dir are added to .gitignore file as folder and file names are
too long to be pushed to git. Make sure to add them to data dir so your folder structure looks like this

├─ data/                       ← create manually
│  ├─ dicom-images-train/      ← original SIIM folders
│  └─ dicom-images-test/
├─ src/                        ← reusable code
│  ├─ __init__.py
│  └─ utils.py
├─ tools/                      ← helper scripts
│  ├─ flatten_dicom_tree.py
│  └─ make_previews.py
